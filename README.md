# Password Generator
## Weekly Project #3

Please use this awesome password generator website to create a custom, randomized password that will help secure your accounts from those devious hackers.

Click the "Generate Password" button to get started! Answer the prompts that pop up in your browser, and your custom password will appear before your very eyes! 

This seemingly simple website was created with mostly JavaScript, determining a pool of characters to randomly choose from based on your selections. There's a lot going on under the hood with this one. Please take a look!
